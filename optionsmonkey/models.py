    stock_price : float
            Spot price of the underlying.
    volatility : float
        Annualized volatility.
    interest_rate : float
        Annualized risk-free interest rate.
    min_stock : float
        Minimum value of the stock in the stock price domain.
    max_stock : float
        Maximum value of the stock in the stock price domain.
    strategy : list
        A Python list containing the strategy legs as Python dictionaries.
        For options, the dictionary should contain up to 7 keys:
            "type" : string
                Either 'call' or 'put'. It is mandatory.
            "strike" : float
                Option strike price. It is mandatory.
            "premium" : float
                Option premium. It is mandatory.
            "n" : int
                Number of options. It is mandatory
            "action" : string
                Either 'buy' or 'sell'. It is mandatory.
            "prevpos" : float
                Premium effectively paid or received in a previously opened
                position. If positive, it means that the position remains
                open and the payoff calculation takes this price into
                account, not the current price of the option. If negative,
                it means that the position is closed and the difference
                between this price and the current price is considered in
                the payoff calculation.
            "expiration" : string | int
                Expiration date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format or number of days
                left before maturity, depending on the value in 'use_dates'
                (see below).
        For stocks, the dictionary should contain up to 4 keys:
            "type" : string
                It must be 'stock'. It is mandatory.
            "n" : int
                Number of shares. It is mandatory.
            "action" : string
                Either 'buy' or 'sell'. It is mandatory.
            "prevpos" : float
                Stock price effectively paid or received in a previously
                opened position. If positive, it means that the position
                remains open and the payoff calculation takes this price
                into account, not the current price of the stock. If
                negative, it means that the position is closed and the
                difference between this price and the current price is
                considered in the payoff calculation.
        For a non-determined previously opened position to be closed, which
        might consist of any combination of calls, puts and stocks, the
        dictionary must contain two keys:
            "type" : string
                It must be 'closed'. It is mandatory.
            "prevpos" : float
                The total value of the position to be closed, which can be
                positive if it made a profit or negative if it is a loss.
                It is mandatory.
    dividend_yield : float, optional
        Annualized dividend yield. Default is 0.0.
    profit_target : float, optional
        Target profit level. Default is None, which means it is not
        calculated.
    loss_limit : float, optional
        Limit loss level. Default is None, which means it is not calculated.
    opt_commission : float
        Broker commission for options transactions. Default is 0.0.
    stock_commission : float
        Broker commission for stocks transactions. Default is 0.0.
    compute_expectation : logical, optional
        Whether or not the strategy's average profit and loss must be
        computed from a numpy array of random terminal prices generated from
        the chosen distribution. Default is False.
    use_dates : logical, optional
        Whether the target and maturity dates are provided or not. If False,
        the number of days remaining to the target date and maturity are
        provided. Default is True.
    discard_nonbusinessdays : logical, optional
        Whether to discard Saturdays and Sundays (and maybe holidays) when
        counting the number of days between two dates. Default is True.
    country : string, optional
        Country for which the holidays will be considered if 'discard_nonbusinessdyas'
        is True. Default is 'US'.
    start_date : string, optional
        Start date in the calculations, in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. Default is "".
        Mandatory if 'use_dates' is True.
    target_date : string, optional
        Target date in the calculations, in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. Default is "".
        Mandatory if 'use_dates' is True.
    days_to_target_date : int, optional
        Number of days remaining until the target date. Not considered if
        'use_dates' is True. Default is 30 days.
    distribution : string, optional
        Statistical distribution used to compute probabilities. It can be
        'black-scholes', 'normal', 'laplace' or 'array'. Default is 'black-scholes'.
    nmc_prices : int, optional
        Number of random terminal prices to be generated when calculationg
        the average profit and loss of a strategy. Default is 100,000.
